"I cannot provide bounding boxes as I am a text-based AI and cannot process image data.  However, I can extract the structured information from the provided text, along with confidence scores (estimated based on the clarity and certainty of the text extraction).\n\n\n**Structured Information Extraction:**\n\nThe provided text is a set of instructions or requirements for a KYC (Know Your Customer) document upload system, not a hospital tariff sheet.  Therefore,  the standard codes and categories for hospital tariffs are not applicable.\n\n\nHere's a structured representation of the information, along with estimated confidence scores:\n\n\n| Section | Item | Description | Confidence Score |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Setup** | Setup Next.js App | `npx create-next-app@latest kyc-system` | 0.99 |\n| **Setup** | Install Dependencies | `npm install @mui/material axios multer sqlite3` | 0.99 |\n| **API Routes** | POST /api/upload | Handles file uploads | 0.98 |\n| **API Routes** | GET /api/documents | Fetches uploaded documents | 0.98 |\n| **API Routes** | PATCH /api/verify | Admin verifies/rejects documents | 0.98 |\n| **User Interface** | Create Upload Form | Create an upload form with validation | 0.95 |\n| **User Interface** | Show Uploaded Documents | Show uploaded documents with their status | 0.95 |\n| **User Interface** | Restrict Duplicate Usage | Restrict duplicate document usage | 0.95 |\n| **Admin Interface** | Display User Submissions | Display user submissions | 0.95 |\n| **Admin Interface** | Provide Validation Actions | Provide validation actions | 0.95 |\n| **Expected Outcome** | User Upload Requirement | Users must upload different documents for different KYC purposes | 0.97 |\n| **Expected Outcome** | Admin Actions | Admins can review, approve, or reject documents | 0.97 |\n| **Bonus (Optional)** | Authentication | Implement authentication (NextAuth or Firebase) | 0.95 |\n| **Bonus (Optional)** | File Storage | Store files in AWS S3 | 0.95 |\n| **Deliverables** | Source Code | Source code in a GitHub repo | 0.95 |\n| **Deliverables** | README | A README explaining setup and API details | 0.95 |\n\n\n**Note:** The confidence scores are subjective estimations based on the assumption that the OCR was accurate.  In a real-world scenario, more sophisticated techniques (like using contextual understanding and NLP) would be applied for better accuracy and confidence scores.\n"
