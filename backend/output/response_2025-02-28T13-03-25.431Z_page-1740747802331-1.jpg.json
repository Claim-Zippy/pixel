"Here's a structured extraction of information from the provided hospital tariff image.  Since this is a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and not a hospital tariff sheet, the standard codes and categories for medical tariffs won't apply.  Instead, I'll provide a structured output reflecting the information present.  Note that bounding boxes are difficult to provide accurately without precise pixel coordinates from the image processing system.\n\n**Structured Data Extraction:**\n\n| Field                     | Value                                      | Confidence Score | Bounding Box (Approximate) |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|\n| Document Type             | No Objection Certificate (NOC)              | 1.0                | (230, 230, 700, 260)     |\n| Date                       | Not specified in image                     | 0.0                | -                           |\n| Recipient                 | Whomsoever it may concern                   | 1.0                | (80, 320, 520, 340)     |\n| Organization              | ESHWAY                                      | 1.0                | (360, 350, 430, 370)     |\n| Grant Recipient           | Eshu Koli                                    | 1.0                | (590, 370, 660, 390)     |\n| Grant Source             | IOE grant from SINE, IIT Bombay            | 1.0                | (350, 350, 700, 390)     |\n| Grant Purpose             | Startup's operations                        | 1.0                | (460, 460, 800, 500)      |\n| Team Member 1 - Name     | Akshat Kumar Gupta                          | 1.0                | (250, 760, 420, 780)     |\n| Team Member 1 - Signature | Akshat Kumar Gupta (210050010) 22-Feb-25  | 1.0                | (530, 760, 780, 790)     |\n| Team Member 2 - Name     | Likhitha Nalla                              | 1.0                | (250, 820, 400, 840)     |\n| Team Member 2 - Signature | Nalla Likhitha (21b030023) 23-Feb-25     | 1.0                | (530, 820, 770, 850)     |\n| Team Member 3 - Name     | Vallabh Behere                             | 1.0                | (250, 880, 400, 900)     |\n| Team Member 3 - Signature | Behere Vallabh Suresh (21b030010) 24-Feb-25 | 1.0                | (530, 880, 780, 910)     |\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* **Confidence Scores:**  These are subjective estimations based on the clarity of the text in the image.  A fully automated system would need more sophisticated OCR and confidence estimation techniques.\n* **Bounding Boxes:** The provided bounding boxes are approximations.  A real-world application would use pixel coordinates from the image processing step.\n* **Date:** The specific date of the NOC is missing from the provided document image.\n* **Missing Fields:**  The structured data only includes the information readily visible and relevant from the provided image.  More detailed information may exist in a full document.\n\n\nThis structured output facilitates easier data processing and analysis, such as searching, filtering, and reporting on the key attributes within the NOC.  In a real-world application, this data could be stored in a database for future reference and analysis.\n"
