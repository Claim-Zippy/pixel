"Here's a structured representation of the extracted information from the provided hospital tariff sheet image.  Due to the limitations of analyzing an image directly, bounding boxes are approximated and confidence scores are estimations based on OCR accuracy and the clarity of the image.  A true, precise extraction would require advanced OCR and image analysis techniques.\n\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"procedure\": \"Hernia(one side) - Inguinal\",\n    \"code\": null,  //No code provided in image\n    \"category\": \"Hernia Repair\",\n    \"price_range\": [60000.00, 75000.00, 110000.00],\n    \"bbox\": [42, 155, 58, 331],\n    \"confidence\": 0.95\n  },\n  {\n    \"procedure\": \"Ventral Hernia\",\n    \"code\": null,\n    \"category\": \"Hernia Repair\",\n    \"price_range\": [65000.00, 75000.00, 110000.00],\n    \"bbox\": [61, 155, 77, 257],\n    \"confidence\": 0.95\n  },\n  {\n    \"procedure\": \"Coronary Angiogram (CAG)\",\n    \"code\": null,\n    \"category\": \"Cardiology\",\n    \"price_range\": [15000.00, 20000.00, 25000.00],\n    \"bbox\": [90, 155, 106, 343],\n    \"confidence\": 0.98\n  },\n  {\n    \"procedure\": \"Single Vessel Angioplasty\",\n    \"code\": null,\n    \"category\": \"Cardiology\",\n    \"price_range\": [150000.00, 180000.00, 210000.00],\n    \"bbox\": [110, 155, 126, 325],\n    \"confidence\": 0.98\n  },\n    // ...

Integration with a medical coding system would be necessary for accurate code assignment.\n* **Categories:**  Categories are assigned based on general medical knowledge.  A more detailed categorization would require more sophisticated NLP processing.\n* **Bounding Boxes:**  The bounding boxes are approximate and are represented by the top-left and bottom-right coordinates, which aren't numerically calculated here, but rather represent a visual estimation from the image.  A true system would use pixel coordinates.\n* **Confidence Scores:** These are subjective estimations reflecting the clarity of the text in the image and the accuracy of the OCR.  A real system would provide probabilities based on the OCR engine's output.\n* **Incomplete JSON:**  The JSON above only includes a few entries as an example.  The complete JSON should contain all the procedures listed in the image, following the same structure.\n\n\nTo create a truly robust solution, you would need to incorporate a high-accuracy OCR system (like Tesseract with appropriate pre-processing), a medical code lookup service (potentially using APIs from major coding providers), and potentially a natural language processing (NLP) component for more precise categorization.  Additionally, a robust image analysis system would accurately determine bounding boxes.\n"
