"Here's a structured extraction of information from the provided hospital tariff image.  Due to the image quality and the handwritten nature of some entries, confidence scores are estimations. Bounding boxes are not possible without image processing tools, so I will describe their approximate locations instead.\n\n\n**Data Structure:**\n\n| Room Type             | Room Number(s) | Room Rent (INR) | Nursing Charges (INR) | Features                                                                                                                                   | Confidence | Location Description                                         |\n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Male General Ward     | M1-M10          | 650               | 350                    | 10 bedded room, solar hot water facility                                                                                                       | 0.95       | Top left section, under \"MALE GENERAL WARD\"                 |\n| Female General Ward   | F1-F10          | 650               | 350                    | 10 bedded room, solar hot water facility                                                                                                       | 0.95       | Top left section, under \"FEMALE GENERAL WARD\"              |\n| Twin Sharing          | 201, 211, etc.   | 1200              | 500                    | Twin sharing room with attendant cot, new toilet, solar hot water facility                                                                 | 0.9        | Middle left, under \"TWIN SHARING\"                          |\n| Twin Sharing Single   | 302, 303, etc.   | 2400              | 500                    | Single room                                                                                                                                   | 0.85       | Middle left, under \"TWIN SHARING SINGLE\"                     |\n| Private Non A/C Small | 103, 105, etc.   | 1900              | 500                    | Single cozy room, furnished interiors, separate attendant cot, new toilet, solar hot water facility, toiletries                          | 0.8        | Middle-right column, under \"PRIVATE NON A/C SMALL\"        |\n| Private Non A/C Medium| 101, 104, 301   | 2400              | 500                    | Single cozy room, furnished interiors, separate attendant cot, new luxury toilet, toiletries, solar hot water, geyser facility 24hrs.      | 0.8        | Middle-right column, under \"PRIVATE NON A/C MEDIUM\"       |\n| Private A/C Small     | 113              | 3000              | 500                    | Single cozy room with extra space & balcony/sofa, furnished interiors, TV/intercom, separate attendant cot, luxury toilet, toiletries     | 0.75       | Middle-right column, under \"PRIVATE A/C SMALL\"             |\n| Private A/C Large     | 110              | 4000              | 500                    | Single large luxury room, adjustable remote controlled patient beds, A/C & TV/intercom, fully furnished, separate attendant cot, luxury toilet | 0.7        | Middle-right column, under \"PRIVATE A/C LARGE\"             |\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* **Confidence Scores:** These are subjective estimations based on the clarity of the text and potential for OCR errors.  Higher confidence implies less chance of error.\n* **Location Description:**  Instead of precise bounding boxes (which require image processing), I provide a general location within the table.\n* **Ambiguity:** Some entries, especially feature descriptions, had slightly ambiguous phrasing which may be subjective to interpretation.\n* **Currency:**  INR (Indian Rupees) is assumed as the currency based on the context.\n\n\nTo improve the accuracy and automate the extraction, one should use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software combined with image pre-processing techniques and a structured data extraction framework.  This would also allow for the generation of accurate bounding boxes.\n"
